## Biography

Been an active member in Android community for over 7 years, where 6 years was spent working at one of the largest software agency in Android. I have dabbled in all form of products from a simple textbook apps to advanced apps such as real time cinema booking systems. Started from an internship, and rose to lead the whole mobile development team, I have a belief that a long term investment will pay off in the end. 

On the development side, currently developing Android and iOS Apps, as well as managing the Gitlab CI/CD pipelines for deployment and testing of the app. I also do research on new trends and libraries and find ways to integrate if they seem fit for the projects.

On the management side, handling research and development of new technology stack, such as new Jetpack libraries, navigation architecture.. etc, analyzing technical difficulties and coming up with long-lasting solutions, mentoring and code reviews of my peers. 

Aside from my professional career, I also believe in contributing and giving back to the community. I run a [personal blog](https://medium.com/@aungkyawpaing), where I reguarly share technical knowlege as well as opinions on software devleopment, and [particpate as a speaker](https://speakerdeck.com/vincentpaing_) in local community events as well as global ones, such as Droidcon Phillipines, DroidYangon, Google DevFest, Developer Conference Myanmar, Barcamp Yangon and many more. Me and a friend of mine are also working on hosting the first ever Burmese Tech Podcast, [Techshaw](https://anchor.fm/techshaw), where we share knowledge about everything related to technology. Last, but not least, I also release tutorials at my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AungKyawPaing) in Burmese language for local developers to learn about Android Development.

## App Showcase

__Yat Ywar A Than (Community Voice)__

Community Voice is a local podcast app that is made as a channel for ethnic people in Burma to voice out their opinions. We use ExoPlayer as main player for all audio and videos in the app. There's a single exo player instance that is used across both foreground and background, and this global manager emit events which are subscribed by the background service as well as foreground UI to render the current state of the palyer. It also utilizes Exoplayer cache to save the data cost on downloading podcasts, where we copy part of already-cached data before downloading start. The app also has a section to edit audio, before uploading episodes. We fork [RingDroid](https://github.com/google/ringdroid) and wrote a custom implemenation combined with FFMpeg for the audio editor.

Myanmar Media 7 is a news and media App. The app includes a section where user can pay a subscription fee to watch tv series made by Myanmar Media 7 Company. We uses Viemo service to host videos and uses Exoplayer to stream these files back  onto the device.
