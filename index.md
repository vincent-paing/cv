## Biography

Been an active member in Android community for over 7 years, where 6 years was spent working as Android dev at one of the largest software agency in Myanmar. I have dabbled in all form of products from a simple textbook app to real time cinema booking systems. Started from an internship, and rose to lead the whole mobile development team, I have a belief that a long term investment will pay off in the end. 

Regarding the experience with software development, I'm developing Android and iOS Apps, as well as managing the Gitlab CI/CD pipelines for deployment and testing of the app.

As for the management, I'm currently handling research and development of new technology stack, such as Jetpack Compose, navigation architecture.. etc, analyzing technical difficulties and coming up with long-lasting solutions, mentoring and code reviews of my peers. 

Aside from my professional career, I believe in contributing and giving back to the community. And for that, I run a [personal blog](https://www.aungkyawpaing.dev/), where I regularly share technical knowledge as well as my opinions. Moreove, I do [particpate as a speaker](https://speakerdeck.com/vincentpaing_) in local community events as well as global ones, such as Droidcon Philippines, DroidYangon, Google DevFest, Developer Conference Myanmar, Barcamp Yangon and many more. Me and a friend of mine are also hosting the first ever Burmese Tech Podcast, [Techshaw](https://anchor.fm/techshaw), where we share knowledge about everything related to technology. Last, but not least, I also release tutorials at my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AungKyawPaing) in Burmese language for local developers to learn about Android Development.
