## Biography

Been an active member in Android community for over 7 years, where 6 years was spent working at one of the largest software agency in Android. I've dabbled in all form of products from a simple textbook apps to advanced apps such as real time cinema booking systems. Started from and internship, and rose to lead the whole mobile development team, I have a belief that a long term investment will pay off in the end. 

On the development side, currently developing Android and iOS Apps, as well as managing the Gitlab CI/CD pipelines.

On the management side, handling research and development of new technology stack, such as new Jetpack libraries, navigation architecture.. etc, analyzing technical difficulties and coming up with long-lasting solutions, mentoring and code reviews of my peers. 

Aside from my professional career, I also believe in contributing and giving back to the community. I run a [personal blog](https://medium.com/@aungkyawpaing), where I reguarly shares technical knowlege as well as my opinions on software devleopment, and [particpate as a speaker](https://speakerdeck.com/vincentpaing_) in local community events as well as global ones, such as Droidcon Phillipines, DroidYangon, Google DevFest, Developer Conference Myanmar, Barcamp Yangon and many more. Me and a friend of mine are also working on hosting the first ever Burmese Tech Podcast, [Techshaw](https://anchor.fm/techshaw), where we share knowledge about everything related to technology. Last, but not least, I also release tutorials at my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AungKyawPaing) in Burmese language for local developers to learn about Android Development.
