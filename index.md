## Biography

Been an active member in Android community for over 7 years, where 6 years was spent working at one of the largest software agency in Android. I have dabbled in all form of products from a simple textbook apps to advanced apps such as real time cinema booking systems. Started from an internship, and rose to lead the whole mobile development team, I have a belief that a long term investment will pay off in the end. 

On the development side, currently developing Android and iOS Apps, as well as managing the Gitlab CI/CD pipelines for deployment and testing of the app. I also do research on new trends and libraries and find ways to integrate if they seem fit for the projects.

On the management side, handling research and development of new technology stack, such as new Jetpack libraries, navigation architecture.. etc, analyzing technical difficulties and coming up with long-lasting solutions, mentoring and code reviews of my peers. 

Aside from my professional career, I also believe in contributing and giving back to the community. I run a [personal blog](https://medium.com/@aungkyawpaing), where I reguarly share technical knowlege as well as opinions on software devleopment, and [particpate as a speaker](https://speakerdeck.com/vincentpaing_) in local community events as well as global ones, such as Droidcon Phillipines, DroidYangon, Google DevFest, Developer Conference Myanmar, Barcamp Yangon and many more. Me and a friend of mine are also working on hosting the first ever Burmese Tech Podcast, [Techshaw](https://anchor.fm/techshaw), where we share knowledge about everything related to technology. Last, but not least, I also release tutorials at my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AungKyawPaing) in Burmese language for local developers to learn about Android Development.

## App Showcase
__Abacus Field__

Abacus Field is an field app made for the Microfinance Agents. The app is mostly used in Africa, where the Interent connection is not reliable. So the app is made as offline-first approach where we freeze information of clients when downloading onto device and synced back and unfrezze later when the agent come back from the field to office.

__Recycle Myanmar__

The Award Winning app for Public Service Distinction at Asia Smart App Awards, Recycle Myanmar is a platform that connects recyclers and pickers through their mobile communication. The app has two parts, one for the recyclers and one of the pickers. It uses GPS to locate the nearest pickers, where the recycler can track when the picker will arrives, and the pickers can see the real time position of all the requested recyclers near them.

__mVoter__

mVoter is the official voter information app endorsed by Union Eelection Comission. It serves as a one-stop information provider app from 2015 General Election, 2017 By-election to 2020 General Election. We develop this app with Single Acitivty Architecture with the use of Conductor, a view-based controllers. The project extensively uses modern android development architectures, and technolgoy such as Firebase Cloud functions. The codes are fully open sourced and developed visibilty to everyone. This was developed by me and a group of friends as a civic contribution to the country.
